preface
artificial intelligence (ai) is a big field, and this is a big book. we have tried to explore the
full breadth of the field, which encompasses logic, probability, and continuous mathematics
perception, reasoning, learning, and action fairness, trust, social good, and safety and
applications that range from microelectronic devices to robotic planetary explorers to online
services with billions of users.

the subtitle of this book is a modern approach. that means we have chosen to tell the
story from a current perspective. we synthesize what is now known into a common
framework, recasting early work using the ideas and terminology that are prevalent today.
we apologize to those whose subfields are, as a result, less recognizable.

new to this edition
this edition reflects the changes in ai since the last edition in 2010

we focus more on machine learning rather than hand-crafted knowledge engineering,
due to the increased availability of data, computing resources, and new algorithms.
deep learning, probabilistic programming, and multiagent systems receive expanded
coverage, each with their own chapter.
the coverage of natural language understanding, robotics, and computer vision has
been revised to reflect the impact of deep learning.
the robotics chapter now includes robots that interact with humans and the application
of reinforcement learning to robotics.
previously we defined the goal of ai as creating systems that try to maximize expected
utility, where the specific utility informationthe objectiveis supplied by the human
designers of the system. now we no longer assume that the objective is fixed and
known by the ai system instead, the system may be uncertain about the true objectives
of the humans on whose behalf it operates. it must learn what to maximize and must
function appropriately even while uncertain about the objective.

we increase coverage of the impact of ai on society, including the vital issues of ethics,
fairness, trust, and safety.
we have moved the exercises from the end of each chapter to an online site. this allows
us to continuously add to, update, and improve the exercises, to meet the needs of
instructors and to reflect advances in the field and in ai-related software tools.
overall, about 25% of the material in the book is brand new. the remaining 75% has
been largely rewritten to present a more unified picture of the field. 22% of the citations
in this edition are to works published after 2010.

overview of the book
the main unifying theme is the idea of an intelligent agent. we define ai as the study of
agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions. each such agent
implements a function that maps percept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways
to represent these functions, such as reactive agents, real-time planners, decision-theoretic
systems, and deep learning systems. we emphasize learning both as a construction method
for competent systems and as a way of extending the reach of the designer into unknown
environments. we treat robotics and vision not as independently defined problems, but as
occurring in the service of achieving goals. we stress the importance of the task
environment in determining the appropriate agent design.

our primary aim is to convey the ideas that have emerged over the past seventy years of ai
research and the past two millennia of related work. we have tried to avoid excessive
formality in the presentation of these ideas, while retaining precision. we have included
mathematical formulas and pseudocode algorithms to make the key ideas concrete
mathematical concepts and notation are described in appendix a  and our pseudocode is
described in appendix b .

this book is primarily intended for use in an undergraduate course or course sequence. the
book has 28 chapters, each requiring about a weeks worth of lectures, so working through
the whole book requires a two-semester sequence. a one-semester course can use selected
chapters to suit the interests of the instructor and students. the book can also be used in a
graduate-level course (perhaps with the addition of some of the primary sources suggested
in the bibliographical notes), or for self-study or as a reference.

throughout the book, important points are marked with a triangle icon in the margin.
wherever a new term is defined, it is also noted in the margin. subsequent significant uses
of the term are in bold, but not in the margin. we have included a comprehensive index and
an extensive bibliography.

term

the only prerequisite is familiarity with basic concepts of computer science (algorithms,
data structures, complexity) at a sophomore level. freshman calculus and linear algebra are
useful for some of the topics.

online resources
online resources are available through pearsonhighered.com/cs-resources or at the
books web site, aima.cs.berkeley.edu. there you will find
exercises, programming projects, and research projects. these are no longer at the end
of each chapter they are online only. within the book, we refer to an online exercise
with a name like exercise 6.nary. instructions on the web site allow you to find
exercises by name or by topic.
implementations of the algorithms in the book in python, java, and other programming
languages (currently hosted at github.com/aimacode).
a list of over 1400 schools that have used the book, many with links to online course
materials and syllabi.
supplementary material and links for students and instructors.
instructions on how to report errors in the book, in the likely event that some exist.

book cover
the cover depicts the final position from the decisive game 6 of the 1997 chess match in
which the program deep blue defeated garry kasparov (playing black), making this the first

time a computer had beaten a world champion in a chess match. kasparov is shown at the
top. to his right is a pivotal position from the second game of the historic go match
between former world champion lee sedol and deepminds alphago program. move 37 by
alphago violated centuries of go orthodoxy and was immediately seen by human experts as
an embarrassing mistake, but it turned out to be a winning move. at top left is an atlas
humanoid robot built by boston dynamics. a depiction of a self-driving car sensing its
environment appears between ada lovelace, the worlds first computer programmer, and
alan turing, whose fundamental work defined artificial intelligence. at the bottom of the
chess board are a mars exploration rover robot and a statue of aristotle, who pioneered the
study of logic his planning algorithm from de motu animalium appears behind the authors
names. behind the chess board is a probabilistic programming model used by the un
comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty organization for detecting nuclear explosions
from seismic signals.

stuart would like to thank his wife, loy sheflott, for her endless patience and boundless
wisdom. he hopes that gordon, lucy, george, and isaac will soon be reading this book after
they have forgiven him for working so long on it. rugs (russells unusual group of
students) have been unusually helpful, as always.

peter would like to thank his parents (torsten and gerda) for getting him started, and his
wife (kris), children (bella and juliet), colleagues, boss, and friends for encouraging and
tolerating him through the long hours of writing and rewriting.
